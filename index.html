            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>Hello! I'm Leonardo Soto.
                 My journey in the world of technology began with a deep dive into cybersecurity, where I honed my skills in understanding the intricacies of
                  digital threats and how to combat them. This foundation in cybersecurity not only enhanced my analytical and problem-solving abilities, 
                  but it also ignited a passion within me for web development. Today, as a future full stack developer, I am on a mission to create intuitive, 
                  secure, and impactful digital solutions. My background in cybersecurity gives me a unique perspective when developing applications, ensuring 
                  that they are not only user-friendly but also fortified against potential vulnerabilities. I believe in continuous learning, and every 
                  project I undertake is an opportunity for me to expand my horizons. Whether I'm debugging code, designing a user interface, or optimizing
                 database queries, my goal remains the same: to deliver excellence.
